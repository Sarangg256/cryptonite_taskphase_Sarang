Module 3: comprehending commands

this module was mainly about the usage of a critical linux command called cat. 
it is used to read out a given file.
i solved the first few challenges by catting the flag and submitting it.
the next few challenges were tricky. as the flag was not in the home directory, so i had to specify the cat's argument as absolute paths.
This modue included the grep command which is used to search for the contents we need.
i solved this challenge by using the hint given. I used grep command to find out the flag in a file.
Another command in this module was the touch command. It is used to create files. I solved this challenge by creating a file using touch command. 
Some files are also hidden. I solved these challenges by using the ls command to list out all the files. The files which were hidden were shown by using the -a command along with ls (ls -a).
for the last few modules i had to use the find command and search for clues. I found the flags using these clues in the directory.
