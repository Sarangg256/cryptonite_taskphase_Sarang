module 4: Digesting documentation 

This module is about looking for help on how to use programs in linux. 

I completed the first module by just passing an argument along with the /challenge/challenge command.

The next few challenges are more tricky. I completed them using the man command. man is short for manual, and will display the manual of the command you pass as an argument.

To solve the reading manual challenge, I simply used the man command to learn the secret option in it which allowed me to print the flag.

For the next challenges, i had to use the man command to search for the hidden manpages which will give me the flag to complete the challenge.

I solved the last 2 challenges by using the help command in order to look for builtins.
