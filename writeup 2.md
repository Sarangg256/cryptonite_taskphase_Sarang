Module 2: pondering paths 

this module was about the basics of linux file paths. 
It included absolute paths and relative paths. 
I solved the first few challenges by using cd command that changes directories, and then found the flag. i had to cd to certain directories to get the flag.
the next few challenges were about relative paths. A relative path is any path that does not start at root.
There are implicit and explicit relative paths.
I solved it by running /challenge/run using a relative path.
